To keep it simple:
My project is a combat system for a turn-based video-game. (See games like Pok√©mon).
I really wanted to incorperate the keyboard in some way, so that's how you command your player.
The game does NOT like the shift button, so it's only lowercase, please do keep that in mind.
You can hold down the moves button, to see what moves are available. AFter typing one of the
moves, your player will deal damage, or heal. After the players turn is over by pressing "END TURN" or by the timer running out, the enemy will do a command itself. The game is over when the players or enemys health reaches 0.
